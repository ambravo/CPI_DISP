CPI Dispatchers

This is a set of artifacts (iFlows and Value Mappings) were created in the form of proof of concept for dispatching messages that use the IDoc and XI adapters.

Eventually SAP will provide a more elegant and definitive solution so these artifacts may lose their usefulness in the (near?) future. (Created in July 2018) 

Dispatcher iflows use the "Process Direct" adapter to reduce network latency when distributing messages.
